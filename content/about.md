My name is Keagan. I began my career by studying Aerospace engineering, but fell in love with coding through the simulation and modeling I did in school. I decided to change paths and now I'm a software developer who loves to use coding to explore my passions for math, physics, graphics, and music.

This blog is a place where I post about my personal projects, things I've been learning about, and whatever else has captured my interest.
